# Task Management App Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to create a simple, offline, desktop application with local storage. This project was intended for learning and enhancing skills within Javascript, HTML and CSS. My intention was to use these tools to keep the project as simple as possible when working with Electron. I used AI to help me with some of the more complex functionality as well as other online learning tools like W3schools etc. I learned a lot in the process about my own skills and limitations of the tool.

## Description
This task management app uses the style of Kanban to help users visualise workflows. Trello is a popular tool for this, as a result I tried to create something similar with an offline-first approach. 

- Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) boards, columns and cards.
- Drag and drop cards between columns.
- Create colourful labels cards.
- Add due date/time to cards.
- Add descriptions and notes to cards.
- Icons show on the card to indicate what data it holds.
